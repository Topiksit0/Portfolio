## Who I am?

I'm Marcus, 20-year-old spanish restless guy, currently studying Software Engineering at UB (Universitat de Barcelona).

I love resolving problems, especially those related with desing, UI/UX, web applications or even algorithms.

When I'm not working or futzing around with code, I study how to escape from University. **Actually for hire**.

## About React

Since I started learning about web development I had the desire on working in a project envolving React, now that I have some free time I'm focused on learning it.

Let's say that there are three main reasons why I sued React over another frameworks like Vue or Angular:
1. React Has a Large Development Community.
2. Easier to learn compared to Angular.
3. High-demand technology.


## About Tailwind

Websites created with Bootstraps are known for their responsiveness and flawless design, but the looks are generic and similar, since I wanted a unique design Tailwind was a better option rather than Bootstrap.
